Tellah:Anna!
Are you alright?!
What did this man
do to you?!
Anna:Father…Edward is the
Prince of Damcyan.
He dressed as a bard to
visit me in Kaipo.
Forgive me for running
away…but I love Edward.
($09)($09)We were about to leave…
to ask your blessing for
our marriage…
($09)Edward:…When Golbez and
the Red Wings attacked
the castle.
Cecil:Who is Golbez?
Edward:I don't know.
They were after the Fire
Crystal.Anna shielded me
from their arrows…

Nothing happened.

Hello!
[Number] Gil per night.
Are you staying?($06)

Come again!

Aaagh!

Edward:Please take this
plant,Cecil.
I pray it will help you…

Better not…

Piet:Captain Cecil,
we're about to arrive!
Cecil:Good.

Biggs:…You can tell he's
troubled as well.
Wedge:We were under
orders,yet…

Wedge:Captain!
Biggs:The Mysidians didn't
even resist!
Cecil:Listen!
Possessing the Crystal is
essential to our
prosperity.
($09)Moreover,His Majesty
deemed the Mysidians know
too much about the
Crystals' secrets.
We are the Red Wings,
the air force of Baron.
The Royal Command is
absolute.
Wedge:Captain…

Piet:Monsters at the fore!

Wedge:Agh!
Cecil:You OK?!
Biggs:More incoming!
Cecil:Stand guard!

Yang:It seems we have
company…
Get ready!

Piet:We're nearing Baron!
Cecil:Prepare to land.

Baigan:Welcome,Captain!
Is that the Crystal?
Cecil:…The Mysidians were
helpless.
Baigan:I'm afraid I don't
understand.
This way,Cecil.

Cecil:Everyone OK?

Baigan:Please wait here.

Baigan:Your Majesty!
I'm afraid the Captain
harbors distrust for the
Crown.
King:Truly?
Well done,Baigan.
But the Crystal is more
important.Call him in.
Baigan:Yes,Your Majesty.

Baigan:Captain!
His Majesty bids you
enter.

King:The kingdom hails
your return.
Where is the Crystal?
Cecil:Here,Your Majesty.

Lost [Crystal]Water Crystal.

Baigan:Ah,look at its
luster!
King:Yes…Cecil,you are
dismissed.

Cecil:…

Cecil:Your Majesty!

King:Yes?
Baigan:You were dismissed,
Captain!

Cecil:What purpose does
collecting the Crystals
serve? We're assaulting
good people for a gem! 
King:Is this disobedience?
Cecil:No,I only mean -
King:I know of your
discontent,Cecil.
If you cannot trust me,
I can no longer trust you
with the Red Wings.
($09)You are hereby relieved
of your post!

King:You are now charged
with bringing this [Ring]Signet
to Mist Village.
($09)Let nothing,not even the
Esper of the valley,oppose
you! You depart in the
morning.

Kain:Your Majesty!

Kain:Cecil meant no
disrespect!

King:Kain! If you're so
concerned about Cecil,
join him.

Cecil:…I'm sorry,Kain.
($09)($09)($09)Kain:Don't worry.
You'll be commanding
the Red Wings in no time.
Cecil:But…
Kain:Save it!
Go to your room and rest.

Kain:What's wrong?
Cecil:I'm sorry for
dragging you into this…
($09)Kain:I defended you by
my own free will.
($09)($09)Cecil:I envy you…When His
Majesty had me master the
dark sword,I hoped it was
to protect - not destroy.
Kain:I understand…
I became a dragoon to
honor my late father.His
Majesty must have his own
reasons,yes? Now,you go
and get some sleep.
Or should I plan on doing
all the work tomorrow?
Cecil:Oh,don't you worry!

This sulfurous magma
allows me to brew these…
($09)($09)I'll give you one if
you've got something
good to trade!

I'm relieved you're
alright! I was anxious.
($09)($09)Cecil:How could we be
hurt? The mages didn't
even raise their hands.

…Let's discuss this later.
Cecil:Very well.

Cecil:What happened to
His Majesty? A kind,good
knight who raised orphans
like Kain and me.
What would a man like
that want with something
like the Water Crystal?
($09)Its value must exceed pure
wealth to order such an
attack…
($09)…Orders or not,my actions
are unpardonable.

…Tell me what happened in
Mysidia.Why are you
delivering something to
Mist?
Cecil:…It's nothing.

Rosa:Then…
Why do you look away?

Cecil:In Mysidia…
We plundered the Crystal
from innocent people.
($09)I never thought my heart
would reflect the color
of my armor,yet here I
am…

Rosa:…You're a good man,
Cecil.

Cecil:I am a dark knight
with no courage to
disobey his king.

Rosa:The Cecil I know
would never whimper like
this! The Cecil I love 
is…

Rosa:-sigh-
You're headed for Mist
in the morning,right?
($09)They say an Esper guards
its valley.If anything
should happen to you,I…

Cecil:…Don't worry.
Kain's coming,too.

Cecil:It's late…
Go back to your room.

Rosa:Come back safe.

Cecil:Thank you,Rosa.
But I know what I've
become.

Cecil:Yang!
Yang:…?!
Cecil:Oh,you don't
recognize me. 
It's me,Cecil! I became
a paladin.
($09)($09)Yang:So the traitor
shows his face.Get them!
Guards:Sir!

Cecil:Yang! What's the
meaning of this?!
Yang:To eliminate
Baron's enemies!

Yang:…Ugh…Cecil? Is it
truly you?
The last thing I remember
is when Leviathan laid
waste to the ship.
Tellah:It seems your power
was being misused while
under a bout of amnesia.
Yang:I see…I'm sorry.

Yang:Rydia was
swallowed by Leviathan.
As for Edward…
I don't know.
Cecil:I see…

Yang:Where am I?
Cecil:Baron.Let's get a
room…there are soldiers
everywhere.
High Monk Yang joined![Song][Claw]($05)[Float] 

Yang:Who is this
gentleman?
Cecil:Sage Tellah,
Edward's father-in-law.
Tellah:My daughter loved
him…enough to give her
own life.
($09)Yang:An honor to meet
you.I am Yang,the high
monk of Fabul.

Porom:Palom!
Yang:I am ashamed.
Cecil:Anyway,we must now
rescue Cid.
Tellah:It won't be easy to
sneak into the castle…

Cecil:The [Key]Baron Key!
They must've entrusted you
with it when you were
under their watch.
With this,we can go
through the Ancient
Waterway!
($09)Received [Key]Baron Key![Song][Claw]($05)[Float]

Just then,the [Ring]Signet
began to glow…

Kain:That was a…
Bomb Signet!
Cecil:…Is this why we
were sent here? To…
Kain:To burn down the
village.

Cecil:Why? WHY?!

Mom,please… -sob-
($09)($09)($09)Cecil:Did you hear that?

Cecil:What happened to
your mother?
Girl:Mom's dragon died,so
Mom…Mom did too! -sob-

Kain:I've heard of these
folk - callers,those who
hold the power to bond
with Espers.
Cecil:So when we defeated
the dragon,we also…her
mother…we…

Girl:YOU killed Mom's
dragon?!
Cecil:We…we never
intended this to happen.

Kain:His Majesty wanted
to wipe out the callers
of this village.
($09)Are you going to finish
the job,Cecil?

Cecil:Kain!
She's just a child!!
($09)($09)Kain:Then you renounce
your loyalty to the
Crown?
($09)Cecil:Yes!

Kain:…You won't be the
only one.
Cecil:Kain?
($09)Kain:I owe His Majesty
much,yet I can't disgrace
the honor of the dragoons.
Cecil:Then you'll…!
Kain:You understand what
this means,Cecil? Baron
is the mightiest country
in the world.
We must have other
countries to join us…
and Rosa as well.
Cecil:Thank you,Kain.
Kain:This isn't for your
sake.

Kain:We need to go!
What of the girl?
Cecil:We can't leave her.

Cecil:Listen,it's
dangerous here! Trust me,
take my -
Girl:No!

Kain:There's no time to
reason.Grab her!
Girl:No!! Leave me alone!

Cecil:Wait!

Girl:Don't come any
closer! Get away from me!

Cecil:Oh…
She's alright.

…We can't stay here.
Kain…please be safe!

Cecil:Where's the inn…?

Hello…oh my word!
She's so pale! Please,take
her to rest,free of
charge!
Cecil:Thank you.

Cecil:You OK?
Girl:…
Cecil:I haven't heard
your name yet.
Girl:…
Cecil:I know I did an
awful thing.I can't ask
your forgiveness.
But at least let me
protect you.Please.
Girl:…

Captain:At last we've
found you,Cecil!
Girl:!
($09)Captain:His Majesty
decrees the callers of
Mist are too dangerous
to let live.
Cecil:What?!
Captain:Give us the girl!
Cecil:I refuse!

Cecil:Are you alright?
Girl:…You put yourself in
danger for me.
($09)Cecil:It's the least I
can do.Forgiveness is out
of the question, but -
Girl:You protected me.

Girl:I'm…Rydia…
($09)($09)($09)Caller Rydia joined!

The light of the
[Crystal]Sand Ruby shone over
Rosa!

Rosa:Mmm…huh…?

Rosa:Oh,Cecil!
Cecil:Rosa…[Song]($13)
($09)($09)Rosa:They said you died
in the earthquake at
Mist.I didn't believe it,
and I set out after you…
Cecil:I'm sorry I worried
you…
($09)($09)Rosa,I have a question.
Who is Golbez?
Rosa:The king invited
him to lead the Red Wings
in your absence.But His
Majesty is no longer the
man he once was.It seems
that he's Golbez's puppet
in his crusade for the
Crystals.The Water Crystal
of Mysidia is already
in his hands…
Next are the other three.
Damcyan's Fire Crystal,
Fabul's Wind Crystal,and
Troia's Earth Crystal.

Edward:The Fire Crystal is
already lost.
Rosa:Who are you?
Cecil:He's Edward,Prince
of Damcyan.And this girl
is Rydia of Mist.
Rydia:Nice to meetcha,
Rosa.You OK now?
Rosa:Yes,thanks to you.
So Damcyan has already
been waylaid…
Then the next target is…
Fabul! -cough,cough-

Cecil:Rosa…you rest
here.
We'll go to Fabul.
($09)Edward:Traveling there
means scaling Mt.Hobs,
whose trail is covered in
thick ice this season…

Rosa:Rydia,can you cast
[Black]Fire?
Rydia:N-No,I can't.

Rosa:As a caller,this
most basic of black magic
should be simple for you…
-cough,cough-

Cecil:Rosa!
Please,save your strength.

Edward:Anna…I miss you.

Anna:Edward…
I must go…
Edward:Anna,please!
Don't leave me!

Anna:Protect the
Crystals…and share your
love with the world,as you
did with me.

Edward:…I will try.
But Anna,my love,what
would you have me do?

Tellah:Fast asleep…must be
exhausted.She's a caller?
Cecil:From Mist Village.
Tellah:She's very gifted.
With proper training,she
could do much more than
call Espers.
($09)She's so sweet…just like
Anna at her age.
Cecil:Anna's your
daughter?
Tellah:Yes.She ran away to
Damcyan with a bard,as I 
disapproved of their
union.

Tellah:Why are you two
heading there?
Cecil:My comrade suffers
from desert fever.
Tellah:A [Crystal]Sand Ruby is
your goal.We must hurry,
then.
($09)Cecil:Tell me about the
monster of these caverns.
Tellah:A horrifying beast
with eight huge tentacles.
We must defeat it to save
Anna and your friend.
I only hope it's not too
late…

Cid:Don't worry!
I'll be back soon!

Rosa:Take care…
Cid:Heh.Now that I got 
you worryin',Rosa,I
will!

Cecil:King Giott,where's
the Crystal?
Giott:Hidden behind my
throne.($02)($02)
As long as I am well,so
is the Crystal!

Yang:!

Cecil:What's wrong?
Yang:I sense someone
watching.
Giott:What?!

Giott:Open the door!

Obtained [Shield]Lunar Shield![Song][Claw]($05)[Float]

King:Yang,you've
returned!
($09)($09)Yang:Your Majesty,the
Kingdom of Baron will
soon mobilize its air
force to seize the Wind
Crystal.A man named Golbez
is behind this.
These heroic souls have
come to warn us.
King:And they are…?

Cecil:Your Majesty,with
all due respect,there's no
no time.
($09)The castle's defenses must
be tightened immediately.
($09)($09)King:But you're one of
Baron's dark knights! How
can I trust you?
($09)Yang:They came to my aid
when all seemed lost.
Rosa:Please,believe us…

Edward:I'm glad to see
you again,Your Highness.
King:Oh! Prince Edward!
How fares Damcyan?
Edward:Destroyed by the
Red Wings.They not only
stole the Fire Crystal,but
killed my parents and my
beloved.Would you let the
same happen to Fabul?

Yang:Let's prepare.

Yang:They are all
outstanding warriors.
I request they join me on
the front lines.
King:Very well.
I leave the battle in
your hands.
($09)Miss,you're a white
wizard,yes? Would you and
the girl kindly aid our
healers?
Rosa:Certainly.

Rosa:Take care.
Cecil:You,too.Rydia,
watch over Rosa for me!

Guard:Here they come!
Yang:Have at them!

Guard:The Red Wings!

Cecil:We won't last
against the airships!
Yang:Retreat!

Yang:Sorry I dragged you
into a hopeless fight.
($09)($09)Cecil:I told you,this war
is not yours alone!
And…we haven't lost yet!

Yang:We must withdraw!

Yang:The king has
already taken refuge with
the women and children!
($09)All that's left is to
draw the enemies near…

…And CRUSH them!

Edward:We can't hold here
any longer!

Yang:The door is locked!
We MUST hold this ground,
for the Crystal is
upstairs!

Yang:What are you
doing?!

Yang:Retreat to the
Crystal Room!

Kain:It's been awhile,
Cecil.
Cecil:Kain!
You're alive!

Cecil:You're one of 
Golbez's…
Kain:I'll put you out of
your misery.
Yang:Stop!

NO!!

Kain:Rosa!
Rosa:Kain,why?!
Kain:…Don't look at me
like that!

You forget yourself,
Kain…

Edward:Golbez!
Cecil:So you…are Golbez…!
Golbez:And you are Cecil.
So we finally meet.
I have something for you!
Edward:Cecil!!
Yang:No!!

Golbez:Hah!

Golbez:That's enough.
Take the Crystal.
Kain:Yes sir.

Rosa:No,Kain!
Kain:!
Cecil:Rosa,don't!
($09)Golbez:Is this woman
important to you?
I see.
We shall meet again.
I'll take her as a token
of this promise.
Come,Kain!

Kain:You had a narrow
escape,Cecil.

Cecil:W-Wait!

Cecil:Rosa…

Rydia:[White]Cure!

Edward:Thanks,Rydia…
But Rosa was taken.
Yang:And the Crystal.
Cecil:Rosa…

Rydia:Come on!
Rosa's alright.
And we can take back the
Crystal,too!

Edward:That's right!

Y'all must be tired.
Please rest here!

Edward:We must rescue
Rosa.
Cecil:But we need an
airship.
Baron is the only country
that has them.
Yang:So the question is,
how do we get there?

Cecil:Baron's main power
is the Red Wings.
Its naval force is
relatively weak.
We go by sea.
($09)($09)($09)Yang:Then I will ask
His Majesty for a ship,
pending his consent.

Who was that dragoon?
Cecil:Kain.He was my
best friend…together,we
swore to take down Baron.
Yang:I see.
Edward:I'm sorry…
Cecil:…

Sheila:Honey,fight bravely
for me!
Yang:Yes,dear!
($09)Sheila:You all,too!
Cecil:Yes ma'am! 

Captain:You're Cecil?
I've heard of your feats!
Make this ship your home.
($09)It won't be long to Baron.
Let's sail!

Captain:Raise anchor!
Sailors:Aye!

Yang:What's the plan
after we reach Baron?

Cecil:What the…?!

Sailors:It can't be!

Captain:Stop screamin' and
stand fast,you buffoons!

Rydia:Aaah!

Yang:Rydia!

Cecil:No!!

Cecil:…
($09)($09)($09)…Ugh…

Cecil:Where am I?

Cecil:Rydia!

Received [Ring]Crystal Ring
and Hero Medal!
($09)($09)The formation has calmed…

Cecil:Yang!

Cecil:Guess I'm…alone.

Porom:Palom,if you'd
please?

Palom:[Black]Ice! 

Palom:Piece of cake!

Golbez:Come,Milon!

Milon:Milon of Earth,at
your service.
Golbez:Cecil aspires to
become a paladin.We must
clip his wings now.
Milon:You are wise to call
me,sir - his dark power
is meaningless against my
undead.We'll dispose of
him.
Golbez:Good.

Golbez:Things have become
interesting,don't you
think,Kain? 

Kain:Yes.But Cecil
might prove quite a
formidable opponent.

Kain:Give me the task of
slaying him instead of
Milon!

Golbez:By what right do
you make such a request?
I remember your blunder at
Fabul.
You will stand here and
watch her.

Tellah:Do you seek [Black]Meteo
as well?
Porom:You know of
[Black]Meteo?! That means…
Palom:Hey,old man! Are
you Tellah? 

Porom:Watch your mouth!
This man is a great sage!

Porom:It's an honor to
meet you.We were ordered
by the Elder -
Palom:To spy on -

-POW!-($05)[Number]($06)

Porom:-ahem-
As I was saying,we're
guiding Sir Cecil up Mt.
Ordeals.I am Porom.
Palom:And I'm Palom! So
you're Sage Tellah.You're
pretty famous in Mysidia!

Tellah:Mysidian children,
eh? Cecil,what happened
to Edward and Rydia?
($09)Cecil:We were attacked
by Leviathan on our way
to Baron.
Tellah:Good heavens…
Cecil:And my friend,
Rosa,was captured by
Golbez.

Palom:Friend? I think he
means GIRLFRIEND!

Porom:Hush!!

Tellah:I cannot defeat
Golbez with my paltry
spells.I've been hunting
for the sealed magic,
[Black]Meteo,ever since we
parted ways.I felt a
strong power from this
mountain,and here I am.
Porom:[Black]Meteo is too
dangerous for you!
You're too old,uh,oops…
Tellah:Yes,I'm old.
But no matter the price,I
must avenge my daughter!

Palom:Why are grownups so
pigheaded?!

Palom:Who's Golbez?
Porom:Don't you know
anything?! He's the man
controlling Baron!

-hiss…hiss…-
($09)($09)($09)Tellah:Watch out!
I sense evil!
($09)($09)I'm glad…glad indeed…
to be able to slay you
all…
($09)Cecil:Who's there?!

I am Golbez's Fiend of
Earth,Milon.
And you shall be a meal
for my undead underlings!

-hiss- Well done.But my
true strength lies in
death,and with it I'll 
drag you all to the abyss!

Milon:How…how could I be
beaten by the likes of
you?!

I have been waiting.
It fills me with sorrow,
but I shall entrust you
with my power…
And grieve that no other
way remains.

Part from your past!
Conquer the darkness
within!
($09)If you can't overcome your
past self,the sacred
power of light will
reject you!

Tellah:There's two of
them!
Palom:What's going on?!
Porom:Sir Cecil!

Cecil:This is my own
fight.I must defeat him
to amend my past sins!

Well done…
Now I shall change my
spirit into the power of
light and trust it to you.
Receive…the last of…my
light!
My son…
Stop…Golbez!
Cecil:P-Please,wait!

Cecil became a paladin!($05)O

Porom:Are you alright?
Palom:So you were serious
about -
Porom:Shh!
Cecil:What's this
feeling…?
It's so familiar.
That voice…
Tellah:O-Oh!
Porom:Sage Tellah?

Tellah:I remember now! All
my spells I'd forgotten!
($09)($09)Tellah has recalled every
spell he ever learned!

Porom:A true sage you
are!
Palom:Hey,Porom…

Porom:Sir Cecil…
Palom:To tell you the
truth,we…

Tellah:OK,I'm ready now!
Let's go get Golbez!

Tellah:What are you doing,
Cecil? We must go!
Cecil:Yes…

Cecil:Edward!

Edward:Cecil…!
You're alive!
Let me join you…ugh!
($09)Tellah:What can you do
in your wretched
condition?
You need to rest.
Edward:Sage Tellah…
I'm sorry.
It's my fault you lost
Anna.
Tellah:…

Yang:For now,Prince
Edward,think only of your
health.

Edward:Yang…
So you too survived
Leviathan's attack.
Then Rydia…?
Yang:…

Edward:…I see.
And I can't do anything to
help…I'm still worthless.

Edward:You must be the
chief engineer,Cid!
Then you have an airship?

Edward:The Dark Elf…

Dark Elf:YoU cANNot gO
aNY fURtheR.
YoU cANNot uSE meTALLic

YoU cANNot deFEaT mE.
I aM inVINCible!!
($09)($09)Yang:You're wrong!
Tellah:Say goodbye!

Edward:They're in danger…

Doctor:Stay in bed!
You're in no condition to
move around!
($09)Edward:I just need to
get to…my…harp.
…Aghhh!
($09)Nurse:Please,listen to the
doctor!
($09)($09)Edward:No…I must…
save them!

The [Harp]Whisperweed began
transmitting the music of
Edward's harp!
($09)Tellah:This melody is…
Cecil:Edward!
($09)($09)Dark Elf:What is tHAT
nASTy sOUND?!
U-ugh!!

Edward:Draw your sword!
The Dark Elf can't
control the magnetic field
while I'm playing!

Dark Elf:CuRSE that MUsic!
The EArth CrySTAL was
suPPosED to graNT me
etERNAL lIFe…!!

Cecil:Thank you,Edward.

Edward:You did it.
Cecil:Yes,thanks to you!
Cid:Where'd ya learn
that tune?

Edward:When I wandered as
a bard,I heard it could
ward off the fae…
($09)Yang:You saved us all,
Prince Edward.
Edward:No…
I didn't…guh!

Edward:Sage Tellah…
Tellah:Anna was lucky to
be loved by a man like
you.
I will avenge her with
[Black]Meteo!
For both of us.
Edward:Thank you…
Cecil:You've become
brave,Edward.
($09)($09)Edward:Anna…I think I
understand what you
were trying to tell me.

Kain:Where's the Earth
Crystal?

Cecil:Kain!
Cid:Where are ya?!
($09)($09)Kain:No need to rush.
Lord Golbez wants to
thank you personally.
Tellah:Golbez!

Golbez:Cecil,you are a
man of your word.
Tellah:Show yourself,foul
demon!!
Golbez:Patience is a trait
with many rewards.Will you
earn yours,Cecil?
($09)I await at the top of the
tower with Rosa.
The Earth Crystal for the
woman.
[Song]($19)Best be quick,though - I 
can't guarantee her life!

Welcome to the Tower of
Zot!

We're glad you could make
it!

We're the minions of
Valvalis of Wind.
($09)($09)Girl:I am Sandy!
Girl:I'm Cindy!
Girl:Call me Mindy.
($09)Mindy:We're the Magus
Sisters!
Cindy:Sorry,but your quest
ends here.
Sandy:Taste our Delta
Attack and say farewell!!

Cindy:No way!
Mindy:The Delta Attack
failed…
Sandy:But how?!

Tellah:Golbez!
Cecil:Where is Rosa?!
Golbez:The Crystal,first.
($09)Cecil:If you've laid a
finger on her,all bets
are off!
($09)Golbez:You should think
higher of me than that,
Cecil.Now,the Crystal?

Lost [Crystal]Earth Crystal.
($09)($09)($09)Cecil:Give back Rosa!
Golbez:Rosa? Whoever are
you talking about?
Cecil:What?!
Cid:You cheated us!
Tellah:Dirty scum…
It's time for your
comeuppance!
Golbez:You and I have no
business,old man.
Tellah:You have no idea
how wrong you are!!

Golbez:[Black]Meteo…but how…?!
Cecil:Tellah!

Golbez:No matter.
The Crystal is in my
possession.Come,Kain!

Kain:…
Golbez:So,[Black]Meteo broke my
hold over you.
So be it!
You no longer serve a
purpose.
We shall settle the score
later,Cecil.

Cecil:Stop!

Cecil learned [Crystal]BigGuard!

Cecil:Ugh…why not…finish
me off…?!
Golbez:You…
You are…
Cecil:…?
Golbez:We will finish
this…another time.

Yang:Cecil!
Cid:You OK?!
($09)($09)Cecil:Y-Yeah.
[Black]Meteo must've weakened
him.
But Tellah!

Tellah:I…failed…
Cid:Don't speak!
($09)($09)Tellah:I…brought this upon
myself…
because I lost myself…
in hatred…($02)($02)
Avenge Anna for me…
please!

Cecil:Tellah!
($09)($09)($09)Yang:No…!
($09)($09)($09)Tellah:…

Cecil:Kain…!
($09)($09)($09)Kain!

Cecil:!
($09)($09)($09)Where's Rosa?!

Rosa:Cecil!

Cecil:Rosa…
($09)($09)($09)Rosa:I knew you'd come…[Song]($13)

Cecil:Your absence taught
me…that I…
Rosa:Cecil…
($09)Kain:…
($09)($09)($09)Cid:Save the cuddles
for when we're not in a
war zone!

Rosa:Kain?!
Cecil:He's free of
Golbez's control.
($09)Kain:…My mind was not my
own.That much is true,but…
($09)($09)But understand,Rosa,
Golbez played no part in
my desire to keep you for
myself.

Rosa:Kain…
($09)($09)($09)Kain:…
($09)($09)($09)Cecil:…
($09)($09)($09)Rosa:Let's fight
together,Kain…

Kain:I beg you…
forgive me,Rosa,Cecil!
Cecil:…

Cid:What part of 'in 
a war zone' don't you kids
understand?![Song]

 

Namingway:Need a new name?
 ($06)

Namingway:Come back
anytime.

Cecil:Let's go,Kain!

It seems Lord Golbez
underestimated your
powers.
($09)Kain:If it isn't
Valvalis,Fiend of Wind…
Show yourself!

Valvalis:Kain,you've
betrayed us!
Kain:I came to my
senses,demon!
Valvalis:I should've
gotten rid of you sooner.
($09)($09)Ah,but how will you fare
now that the old man and
his [Black]Meteo are no more?
($09)Kain:You're not the only
one who can ride the wind,
Valvalis!

Valvalis:You may've bested
me,but the strongest of
the Four Fiends still
remains!
And you will be destroyed,
along with this tower!

Cecil:It's collapsing!
Kain:Curse her…!


Cecil:Where are we?

Rosa:Your room in Baron.
Cid:Reckon it's safe,
since the fake king's
gone.
Kain:Cecil.I have
something to tell you.
It's about the Crystals.

Cecil:I know.The Earth
Crystal is in Golbez's
hands…he has them all.
Kain:Not quite.
Rosa:What do you mean?
Cid:Then the legend's
true?!
Kain:Yes.I speak of…
The Dark Crystals.[Song][Greatsword]

Cid:See,the ones of the
surface can be called
the 'Light Crystals.'
($09)Yang:And these 'Dark
Crystals' are their
antithesis?
Kain:Correct.
Therefore,Golbez has only
half.We verified their
location,buried deep
within the Earth.
Cecil:You don't mean…
Kain:Yes.The Dark
Crystals reside in the
Underworld.
Cid:How'll we get
there? Dig a hole?
Kain:That,I don't know.
($09)He seeks both sets to open
the path to the Moon.
Rosa:What in the world…?
($09)Kain:Your guess is as
good as mine.
Cecil,this stone is the
key.Please,take it.

Received [Stone]Magma Stone!
($09)($09)($09)Kain:Use this at the
altar to open the path to
the Underworld.
Rosa:The…altar?
Kain:It has to be
somewhere on the
Overworld.

Cecil:More incoming?!
Stand guard!!

Cecil:What's that?
Kain:The Red Wings!

Cid:Hold on,
Enterprise…!
Cecil:We're going down!!

King:It's good to see you
are unharmed! I am Giott,
the Dwarf King.Welcome to
the Underworld.
Cecil:Your Majesty,may I
ask about the Dark
Crystals?
($09)Giott:You speak of them
with reverence.You must be
allies.I'm afraid two of
the four have been taken.
But the Crystal of our
castle is still safe!
Nothing stands against
our tanks.
Rosa:They did hold their
own against the airships.
Giott:'Airships?' That's
what you call them?
The Overworld is home to
many curious things.
Could your airship support
our tanks?
Cid:Wish she could,but
she's pretty banged up
after the crash.

Cecil:Cid!

Chief Engineer Cid
left.

Yang:My instincts are
never wrong.

Kain:It's locked!
($09)($09)($09)Yip-ho-ho-ho!

We're Calbrina!
You fools!
You've doomed yourselves!
We're gonna getcha!
We'll take your heads as
presents to Lord Golbez!
Yip-ho-ho-ho!

Cecil:What?!
($09)($09)($09)We meet again,Cecil…

Cecil:Golbez…!
Golbez:You may've harmed
me before,but that old
mage can't save you now.
Might I regale you with
the reason I started this
war? It seems you're all
dying to know.
All eight Crystals are
the key to activating the
Tower of Babil,which leads
to the Moon.
It is said the Moon
possesses powers beyond
human comprehension…
($09)The last Crystal remains,
and soon it will be mine.
A pity you won't live to
see my plans bear fruit!

Cecil:We did it!
We defeated Golbez!

Rosa:It's all thanks to
you,Rydia!
Cecil:You're older now…
What happened?
Rydia:When Leviathan
swallowed me,he took me to
the Feymarch - the place
where Espers live.There,
time flows differently,so…
I grew up!
Kain:Cecil,who is this
woman?
Cecil:Believe it or not,
this is the little girl
we found in Mist.
Kain:That child?!
Yang:Amazing…
Cecil:But…Rydia…
It's all my fault your
mother -
Rydia:Cecil,enough!
We can't undo the past.
Besides,Queen Asura told
me…a great evil is at work
here.We must confront it
together - as allies.
Cecil:Rydia!
($09)Caller Rydia joined! 
[Song][Claw]($05)[Float]

I will not…perish…!

Cecil:He took the
Crystal!

Do you have the clerics'
permission?

Edge:Right,team!
We're off!
($09)($09)Rydia:Oh brother…
($09)($09)($09)Ninja Edge joined![Song][Claw]($05)[Float]

Cid:Now ya can fly over
magma!
Rosa:Thank you,Cid.
($09)Cid:…
($09)($09)($09)Kain:Cid![Song][Rod]($05)[Float]

Proffer the key and the
seal dissolves.

You've put on a
spectacular performance…

Cecil:Golbez!
($09)($09)($09)Golbez:Farewell,fools,and
remember - nothing is
forbidden in war.

Whew! Just in time!
($09)($09)($09)Rosa:Cid!

Cid:Where's Yang?
Rosa:He…
Cecil:To destroy Golbez's
Super Cannon…
Cid:I see…
Rydia:Oh,Yang…!
($09)($09)Cid:Who's this girl?
Cecil:Rydia…
A caller of Mist.

Cid:The engine won't
last much longer!
Cecil,c'mere!

Rosa:Cid!
Cecil:What are you
doing?!

Cid:Get outta the
Underworld!
I'll close the hole up
with this bomb!

Cid:Golbez!
I'll show you the great
fireworks of Cid,chief
engineer!

Cid:Hurry to Baron!

Rosa:Cid!
Rydia:Why?!
Kain:Stubborn old fool…!

Cecil! Boss ordered us to
attach this hook to the
Enterprise.
No,it won't take long!

Now the Enterprise can
hook and carry the
hovercraft.
($09)Press A to hook and unhook
while flying over it.
($09)($09)Now you can explore places
like Cave Eblana near the
Tower of Babil.

Cecil:…About Cid,he -
($09)($09)($09)Oh,we know! The old badger
is one headstrong snip,but
remember,the man means
well.Hey,good luck!

Man:Rubicant! I've been
looking for you!
Rubicant:…Have we met?
($09)Man:I'm Edge,Prince of
Eblan!
Rubicant:So the ninja clan
yet lives.Impressive.
Edge:Exactly!
Witness the power that
saved my people!!

Cecil:You OK?
Edge:How could I…lose…?!
Rosa:We're also after
Rubicant.
Edge:Back off,blondie!
He's mine!!
Kain:Have you any idea
whom you've challenged?
He's one of the Four
Fiends.
Edge:I'm not some
spoiled prince!
The Eblan royal family
are trained ninja!
I don't need your help!
($09)Rydia:Stop it! No more!
I've had enough!!

Rydia:Tellah…Yang…even
Cid! They're all…
They're all…!
Edge:H-Hey,don't cry…

Cecil:Rubicant is the
strongest of the Fiends,
but we must recover the
Crystals.
Edge:I don't like seeing
a lady cry.You're right,
why don't we work
together?
Kain:You won't be of any
use if you're injured.
Rosa,if you please?

Cid:Blazin' bolts!
They're still on our
tail!!

King:Edge…
Edge:Mom,Dad!

Queen:I'm glad to know
that you're well.
Edge:Same here!
($09)Queen:Edge…come…
King:Yes,son,come with us.
Edge:To where?
($09)Queen:To your grave!![Song]($1F)

Sylph:Miss Caller?
Please,summon us to fight
in place of our friend
Yang!
Rydia:Sure!
($09)($09)($09)Rydia learned [Call]Sylph![Song][Claw]($05)[Float]

Edge:Rrraaagh!!
($09)($09)($09)Rosa:Horrible…

Rubicant:Wretched Lugae!
How dare he…?!

Edge:Rubicant!
You…you'll pay for this!
($09)($09)Rubicant:It was that
filthy Lugae who made
chimeras of your parents.
I know how you must feel.
Edge:How dare you?!
You don't know anything!
($09)($09)Rubicant:I know you have
courage,and my respect.
Yet human emotion inhibits
your true strength.
Edge:Emotion…a weakness?
Ha! Let me show you how
wrong you are![Song]($0B)
($09)Edge's anger drew out
[Boomerang]Flood and [Boomerang]Blitz!
($09)($09)Rubicant:Hm…you brim with
power.But will it aid you?
No manner of cold can
pierce my Cloak of Flames! 

Rubicant:I shall restore
you to full strength.
Come,show me your full
power!

Rubicant:…Now I see why
Lord Golbez struggled
against you…
($09)Humans are strongest when
they join forces.I admire
you,warriors!
Farewell…

Touch it?

Edge:You're here!
Steward:Where is
Rubicant?!

Edge:Defeated - by us!
Steward:Befitting of your
great skill,Your Highness.
($09)Edge:It was thanks to
these four backing me up.
Steward:Thank you,brave
warriors!

Edge:By the way,who's
Golbez?
($09)($09)Kain:Rubicant's master.
He hoards the Crystals in
hopes of reaching the
Moon.
Edge:So he's the one
behind all this.
But why the Moon?
($09)Cecil:He seeks to harness
an ancient cosmic power.
Rosa:Our goal is to stop
him from obtaining it.
Edge:So…this goes way
deeper than the attack on
Eblan.
($09)Steward:Your Highness,
what of the plans to
rebuild our kingdom?

Edge:Hey,the world's in
hot water! I can't just
sit around.Besides,I don't
like the sound of Golbez.
Steward:Very well…
But please come back and
visit when you have the
chance.
Warriors,please take care
of our prince!


All:Your Highness,fortune
be with you!
Edge:Okey-dokey!

Edge:Ouch…!
Kain:Seems we've fallen
down to the Underworld.

Tellah:Indeed.
I need to rescue my
daughter,but a gigantic
monster blocks the way.
My magic alone can't
defeat it…but your sword
might help! And this girl
is a caller? She's quite
gifted,I sense.
Cecil:We're also on our
way to Damcyan.
Tellah:Excellent!
Let us work together to
get there.

Cecil:A pitfall?!($05)($0C)($06)

Something dropped…

Cecil:Is this a new
model?
Edge:Let's take this
baby and get out of here.
Rydia:That's stealing.
Edge:Hey,I bet she'd be
happier with us than
Golbez.

Rosa:Isn't this a trap
or something?
Edge:Don't worry! I can
smell a trap a mile away.
Man,this vessel's a
beaut.Let's call her the
Falcon.How do you like
that,Rydia?
Rydia:Fine,sure,just go!
Edge:Uh,OK…
Hi-ho,Falcon!

Cid:Ya call this food?!
How can you people eat
this tasteless pile of -
Cecil:Cid!

Rosa:You're OK!
Cid:Ya thought I'd go
down that easy?!
Edge:Who's the old fart?

Nurse:You must stay in
bed,lali!
Nurse:Wait 'til you heal!

Rosa:Tee-hee!
He seems fine.
Cecil:Indeed.

Palom:Hey! Long time no
see,dude!
Porom:Elder cured our
petrification.
Elder:This war is not
yours alone.
It's for all creatures
living on Earth!

Cecil:What's going on at
the Tower of Babil?

Fusoya:We're too late!

The Giant of Babil is
awake.

Edge:Cecil!

Fusoya:Let us go,Theodor.

Rydia:I passed through
here on my way from
Feymarch. Let's go there
and ask for help.

Received [Crystal]Crystal!

Rydia:Queen Asura.
Asura:I'm glad to see you
again,Rydia…
Rydia:Please,help us.
Asura:I am willing…
But we must uphold Esper
Law.Your worth must be
tested.
Do you have the courage
and strength to challenge
me?

You are the first to best
Asura.But sheer force is
not enough to thwart evil.
($09)True strength lies in the
will to wield that power
for good.
($09)Are you prepared to
contest with me,so I may
ascertain the strength of
your will?

Kain…bring your master
the Crystal…
($09)($09)Cecil:Golbez!

Lost [Crystal]Dark Crystal.[Song]($1F)($05)($1D)

Edge:You scoundrel!
Rosa:Kain!
What are you doing?!
($09)Golbez:I've been waiting
for this moment.
Now the Tower of Babil
will awaken!
The way to the Moon
will open!
Come,Kain! Rejoin your
master.
Cecil:Kain,no!
Remember who you are!

Elder:We've been waiting
for you.
Come to the Tower of
Prayers.

Elder:Everyone,pray!
The legend will be made
reality!

Elder:Look…everyone!
Our prayers…
($09)($09)…are answered!

Elder:The Ark of the
Moon…
($09)($09)The Lunar Whale…![Song]($0E)

Elder:During my prayers,I
heard a voice calling for
you to go to the Moon.
Someone awaits you there.
Cecil:How would we get
there…?

We lost - but you're too
late! Lord Golbez already
knows of this place!

Edge:Blast…you!

Rubicant:Indeed you're
strong…but still no
match for me.
($09)Challenge me again when
you've honed your skills.

Try dropping the
[Stone]Magma Stone?

Cid:Zzz…
($09)($09)($09)Rydia:He must be really
tired.
Rosa:He overworked
himself…
Cecil:Thanks,Cid.

Use the [Crystal]Sand Ruby?

Edge:Thanks,honey!
…Hey,you're pretty cute,
too!

Edge:Right.
Let's go get Golbez!
Rydia:First we're getting
back the Crystals.
Edge:Uh,right.
Let's go!

Edge:Dad…
($09)($09)($09)Mom…
($09)($09)($09)Rest in peace.

Giott:We were worried!

Giott:How did it go?
($09)($09)($09)Cecil:…I'm sorry.
($09)($09)($09)Giott:I see…
Golbez is trying to force
open the Sealed Cave.
($09)It's a matter of time
until he succeeds.I want
you to get the Crystal
before him.
Luca!

Cecil:Cid…
Rosa:You pushed
yourself…
($09)Cid:…Looks like I
served my term.I'll back
outta the limelight for
you kids.

Edge:Hats off to ya,you
old fart.
Rydia:Get well soon…

Cid:Look after Cecil
and Rosa for me.
Edge:Rest and relax,man.

Cid:Take care…
Rosa:You too.
($09)($09)Cid:Now go…
You have no time to waste
on this old man!
Cecil:Thanks,Cid.

     One born from a
     dragon's mouth,
      hoisting both
     light and dark,
      rises high up
     in the sky over
     the still land.
   Veiling the Moon in
  the light of eternity,
   he brings a promise
     to Mother Earth
  with bounty and mercy.

Palom:This old man
learned [Black]Meteo!
($09)($09)Elder:What?! Is our crisis
so dire that the seal came
undone?!
($09)Tellah:I sought [Black]Meteo to
avenge Anna.Golbez took
her life.Now he will pay -
with this!
Elder:You mustn't fight
for vengeance,Tellah.
Moreover,you're in no
condition to use [Black]Meteo.
Tellah:Even if the price
is my life,I must do
this.
($09)Elder:You haven't changed
one bit,have you?
Tellah:Nor have you.
($09)Elder:With Cecil as a
paladin,you could be a
formidable force…
($09)Cecil:Before that can
happen,we need an airship.
Elder:Very well…I'll open
the Devil Road.
Go to Baron.I will pray
for you in the Tower…
Paladin Cecil!

Luca:What is it,Father?
Giott:Give me your
necklace.
Luca:Yessir.
Giott:This is the key to
open the Sealed Cave.
No one can enter without
it.
We must defend the last
Crystal at all cost.

Cecil:We'll do our best.

Cid:Old fart?! Who is
this mannerless brat?!
Edge:I'm Edge,renowned
Prince of Eblan!
Kain:He tells the truth,
though his mouth betrays
his nature.
($09)Edge:You mean my nature
as a handsome,skilled
ninja?

Rydia:The man is injured!
Stop spouting nonsense!
Cid:Sounds like you're
whipped,boy.Heh-heh.
Edge:Oh,shut up.

Cid:By the way…
What's the latest on
Golbez?
($09)Cecil:The Four Fiends are
no more,yet all the
Crystals but one are his…
($09)Rosa:We want to retrieve
it,but the Enterprise is
on the Overworld.
($09)Kain:We've obtained an
enemy airship,but she
can't cross magma.
($09)Cid:Ha-ha!
Now it's my turn!
Can't do anything without
me,can ya?[Song][Pig]

Cid:Pipe down and help
me remodel the airship!
We have no time to waste!

Cecil:Kain!
Rosa:Control yourself!
($09)($09)Kain:I'm…alright.
I'm no longer his puppet!

Kain:Now that all the
Crystals are gathered,the
path to the Moon is ours!
($09)Edge:Stop!

Cecil:Kain…
Edge:Traitor!!

It's a TrapDoor!

Cecil:The wall!
Rosa:It's moving!
($09)($09)Kain:This must be the
final trap guarding the
Crystal!
($09)Edge:So? Let's knock it
all down!

Rydia:We did it!
Edge:Quite a petty trap.

Golbez:Ha-ha-ha!

Giott:Welcome back!
Where's the Crystal?

Cecil:…Forgive us.
Giott:So they have them
all…we're finished.
($09)…Unless the legend comes
true,and the fabled Lunar
Whale appears.
Cecil:The Lunar Whale?[Song]


Giott:It's an enormous ark
spoken of in Dwarven[Song]($1E)
Legend.'One born from
a dragon's mouth -'
Cecil:The Mysidian
Legend?!
Giott:You know of
Mysidia?!
Cecil:It's the city of
magic on the Overworld.
Giott:So it does exist!
Cecil:I wonder how the
Elder's prayers fare…?
Giott:Prayers? Does he
intend to…? Yes! You must
hurry to Mysidia!
Edge:Since the path back
is blocked,we should use
that warp device in the
Tower of Babil.
Rydia:We can't.It had no
power,remember? And we've
defeated everyone who
could repair it.
Edge:…
Then what's our next move?

Let me take care of it![Song]



Cecil:That light called
me its son…
Elder:I know not what it
is or what the legend
means…but we Mysidians
have been told to pray
for its fulfillment for
eons,and to believe in
the one with the sacred
light.I am certain that
one is you.

Cid:I'll attach a drill
to the Falcon's bow so
you can dig your way out!
($09)Rosa:But your wounds…
Cid:Ah,they're nothin'.
Edge:Can you really pull
it off?
Cid:Who d'you think
you're talkin' to?! I'm
Cid,chief engineer!

Palom:Cut the crap!
Porom:You're aware that
your acting is dreaful,
yes?
Cecil:You mean…?!
Baigan:Lord Golbez granted
me the power I've always
wanted! Let me show you!

So,you have defeated
Leviathan.But it could
have been done without the
Power of Light.
Whether you possess the
true light or not…
I,Bahamut,Father of
Espers,shall be the judge!

My name is Ultima…
($09)($09)($09)Left here since birth…
Forgotten in the river of
time…
($09)I've had an eternity to
ponder the meaning of
things…
($09)And now,I have an answer…

Baigan:Cecil!
You've returned!
Cecil:Baigan,did you side
with Golbez as well?
Baigan:As guard captain,I
could never betray my
liege.
($09)Cecil:Then join us!
You'll be a great help.
($09)($09)Guard Captain Baigan
joined![Song][Claw]($05)[Float]

Cid:Right!
Let's get remodelin'!

[Sword]Ultima…
Hmm…
($09)($09)So…you are not as weak as
I thought.
Let's see how strong you
really are.
Draw your weapons!

Elder:The Devil Road lies
below the building east of
town.
($09)We'll be praying not only
for you,but for all those
living on Earth.

Palom:Thanks,old man!
Porom:Mind your manners!
Shall we be off?

Edward:This is the antlion
nest.

Rydia:Aaah!
Edward:Worry not,the
antlion is docile.Now,to 
take the [Crystal]Sand Ruby…

Cecil:Let's go,Rydia!

Show the [Stone]Adamant?

Edward:It can't be…why
did the antlion attack?
($09)($09)Cecil:Docile creatures
are becoming more
aggressive lately.It must
be a portent of some kind…
Rydia:…Let's go cure
Rosa!

Wedge:Yes sir!
Biggs:There are too
many monsters these days…
($09)Cecil:Is it some sort of…
omen?

Cecil:Battle stations!

Knights of Baron…
($09)($09)($09)Kain:Who's there?![Song][Greatsword]
($09)($09)($09)Turn back now and no harm
will come to you.
($09)($09)Kain:Show yourself!
($09)($09)($09)Do you still wish to go
on?

Edward:Cecil…Rosa
wants to be with you.
Can't you see?
($09)Cecil:Fine,Rosa.Let's
go together.But the hour
is late - at least rest
one more night.
Rosa:OK.
($09)($09)($09)White Wizard Rosa
joined!

Rosa:Do you honestly
expect to go very far
without a white wizard?
Cecil:…

Cecil:Rosa!

Edward:Aaagh!

Cecil:Edward!

Cecil:Please,join the
fight!
Kain:I'd planned on it.
Draw your sword!
Cecil:Kain?!
Kain:A duel,Cecil!

Yang:It's time to repay
my debt.Let us heal our
wounds and make a
strategy.
Cecil:Thank you…

-SLAP!-

Cecil:Enough!

Watch me dance?

…

HI-YAAAH!($05)($05)($06)

King:I'm sorry for the
misunderstanding.
Will you help us defend
our Crystal?

King:I see…
We won't force you.

Yang:Take care!
Sheila:Don't worry!

Cecil:Let's find Cid -
he's an airship expert.
Yang:I hope he is well.
Edward:…

Rydia:Are you cold?
You're shivering.
Edward:I'm fine…

Sailor:Is it him?!

Sailor:The Lord of the 
Seas!

Sailor:It's…

Captain:Leviathan!

Watch me dance!

Cecil:-yawn-

Ha-ha-ha…!

Palom:I know! You don't
have to remind me!

Porom:Palom!
Elder said not to submit
to arrogance!

Porom:Shall we?

Golbez:I understand you
respect your former
friend…but Milon will
take care of him.
As one of the Four Fiends,
he'll put on quite a show.
Don't you agree,Rosa?

Kain:Yes sir!
($09)($09)($09)Rosa:Cecil…

Cecil:Tellah!

What a magnificent bauble!
Here…take it.

Porom:Palom!
($09)($09)($09)Tellah:If not for [Black]Meteo,
why are you here,Cecil?
Cecil:To become a
paladin.
My dark sword can't defeat
Golbez,and I've long
sought to renounce the
hateful thing.

Tellah:Yes.He is the root
of every kind of evil.

Tellah:So at the summit
lies the power of a
paladin…
($09)There must truly be a
secret on this mountain.
I shall join you!
($09)Sage Tellah joined![Song][Claw]($05)[Float]

Tellah:Cecil!

Palom:Dude!
Porom:Look out!

Tellah:?!
($09)($09)($09)This is…
($09)($09)($09)…[Black]Meteo?
($09)($09)($09)That light bestowed upon
me the forbidden black
magic!
($09)Tellah learned [Black]Meteo![Song][Claw]($05)[Float]

Palom:Wait a sec!

Porom:Let's be on our
way,Sir Cecil.

Cecil:Where are Rydia
and Edward?

Yang:…What is this?

Biggs:We are the Red
Wings,yet we plundered
like common thieves!

Received [Crystal]Earth Crystal![Song][Claw]($05)[Float]

Cid:Don't worry,
me and the Enterprise'll
take your share.
($09)I've heard you took good
care of Cecil and
Rosa.Now it's my turn!

Edward:Cecil!
Where's Rosa?
($09)($09)Cecil:Golbez said he'd
exchange her for Troia's
Earth Crystal,but the
Dark Elf has stolen it.

Edward:Here…
Cecil:What is it?
Edward:Call it…
my substitute.

Received [Harp]Whisperweed!

Cecil:Here!
Where's Rosa?
Kain:Follow our ship.

Cecil:Fine!

Tellah:This is for Anna!!

($09)        Meanwhile…

Golbez:…?!

Cid:Open your eyes,ya
old fuss!
Tellah:…
Yang:Tellah…
Cid:Rest in peace…
with your daughter…

Kain:…Cecil!
What have I done…?
Cecil:It's not your
fault…
You were hypnotized.
Kain:But I remember it
all.I wanted Rosa -

Kain:In the room above!

Cecil:Tellah…
($09)($09)($09)We will avenge you both.
I swear it.

We need your powers as a
dragoon.
($09)($09)Kain:…Cecil…Rosa…!

White Wizard Rosa and
Dragoon Kain joined![Song][Claw]($05)[Blind]

Cid:So? Let's hop to
it! The Enterprise can
fly around the world in
80 seconds!

Cecil:But she was left at
the Tower of Zot…
Cid:Don't doubt my
ingenuity,boy.
She's outside Baron thanks
to my remote control!
($09)($09)Rosa:Will wonders ever
cease?
Cid:Not where I'm
involved!
Let's head out first thing
to look for the entrance
to the Underworld!

Cecil:But…why didn't
Golbez just finish me
off…?

Rosa:Cecil?

($09)($09)($09)($09)($09)($09)($09)($09)($09)          Thus,
  the Dark Knight Cecil
   was stripped of his
  command as Captain of
 the Red Wings.He and the
   Dragoon Kain set out
 for the Village of Mist,
  beyond a cave shrouded
      in a deep fog.
($09)($09)($09)The advent of the airship
  marked the realization
 of mankind's dreams,but
also a new age of contest.
    Through its royal
   air force,Baron soon
     reigned supreme.
($09)($09)($09)   But why does the king
    seek the Crystals?
 Why do monsters rapidly
 multiply and stir unrest?
($09)($09)($09)($09)   The Crystals silently
     shed their light…
($09)($09)($09)($09)($09)($09)($09)

Well done…
($09)($09)($09)         May the
      - [Sword]Illumina -
 Radiate with your Light![Song][Spear]

Giott:Do you need anything
for the repairs?
Cid:The airship won't
last in the magma.
I gotta go back to the
Overworld and wrap the
hull in mythril.
I'll be back in a jiff!

Received [Crystal]Dark Crystal![Song][Claw]($05)[Pig]

Cecil:But…
Palom:You saw what we
can do,didn't you?
Porom:Agreed!
Tellah:Not to worry.
I'll keep the tykes out
of trouble.
($09)Cecil:OK…
I'm counting on you all.

Palom:Didn't you tell us
to help him?
Porom:Please allow us to
accompany them!
Elder:…The light on Mt.
Ordeals accepted you as
well…yes,this may be your
fate.
Cecil,Tellah,please look
after these children.

That night…

Enter the final conflict?

Mt.Ordeals.

Rosa:Rydia…
Rydia:-sob,sob-

Tellah:We have to hurry
and get rid of Golbez!
Elder:Tellah?
($09)Tellah:It's some time,
Minwu.

Kain:Can't we shake
them?!
Cid:Looks like they
upgraded the Red Wings!

Rydia:They're gaining on
us!
Cid:C'mon,Enterprise…!

Cid:Heh,guess I won't
be playin' Granddad for
you two or Hilda.Tell her
she's my pride 'n joy!
Listen,head to Baron and
get those two lazy bums of
mine to help ya!

Cecil:Cid!
Rydia:No!!

Cid:Be good,Rydia!

Baron!

this!

Yang:Serving as your
comrade was among my
greatest honors.
($09)Cecil:Yang!
Open the door!!

Porom:Well,there you have
it!
Palom:I was pretty
surprised,too!
Cecil:What do you mean?
($09)($09)($09)Elder:I'll admit it.Their
true task was to keep an
eye on you.I'm glad there
was no need.

Use the Frying Pan?

Rydia learned [Call]Leviathan![Song][Claw]($05)[Float]

Elder:My word…
Incredible!

Tellah and Edward:Anna!!

Here to see the girls?
You need a Member's Pass,

Interested?

handle.

handing it over…
to the likes of you!

I detest this Righteous
Sword of Light…
($09)($09)To stop it from reaching
your hand,I shall harness
all of my spirit's power!

Golbez:Goodbye.

Fusoya:Cecil, wait…!
Zeromus is consumed in its
chaotic energy! We can
use this chance…to escape!
Should I transport us back
to the surface?!

Here lie in unrest the
Spirits of the Sinister.
($09)($09)They may be freed from
this Eternal Flame to
battle again.
($09)Are you skilled enough to
thwart the darkness?

This is the Terror-blade
of Perpetual Cataclysm.
You may not wield it.
($09)I,Keeper of the Heavens,
shall judge your resolve
in accord with Esper Law.
Let us commence.
