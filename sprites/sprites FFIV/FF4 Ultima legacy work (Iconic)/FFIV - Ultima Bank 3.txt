This is a Save Point.
[Tent]Tents and [Tent]Cottages may

Golbez:We defeated him.
Fusoya:It's a pity.
($09)($09)The evil consuming him
made it impossible to use
his powers for good.

How're my ships doin'?
…Hey,somethin' up?
Cecil:To tell the truth…
($09)Cid:What?! Who's gonna
lead the Red Wings,then?!
What the heck's the king
thinkin'…
I'm not gonna make him
another airship if he's
usin' 'em to start
unprovoked wars!
Hey,I gotta get goin'.
Hilda's worried 'cause
I've been pullin' too many
all-nighters.
How 'bout you,Cecil?
Keepin' up the basics?
Cecil:I don't think…
Cid:What?!
Get your rear down to the
Training Room tomorrow!
Things are changin' by the
day - stay prepared!
…Oof,I really gotta scram.

Rydia:Is this it?
There's really nothing we
can do?
($09)Cecil:What's that?!

($09)        Welcome to
        Boss Rush!
($09)Here,you'll face a total
of 7 waves of enemies,and
be rewarded after each
wave.
However,if your whole team
is Wounded,your progress
in the current wave will
be lost!
Also,if you leave the
Boss Rush Room,the waves
will reset.
($09)This expert challenge has
many surprises in store,
and gets more difficult
as you progress.
You can use the Save Point
ejust below here to save
between each wave.
($09)Good luck!
($09)($09)($09)Incidentally…if you want
to change your party,I can
quickly 'transport' you to
the Lunar Whale and back.

Edward:Cecil!
Let me show you the
courage you taught me!

Hey there! Super Bosses
giving you trouble? Start
using Advanced Battle
Strategies.
But be careful.Some bosses
won't be too happy with
these strats…use them at
your own peril!
…Huh? Why am I here…?
They thought Chief needed
an assistant,that's all.

Remarkable…
($09)($09)($09)      Legendary Bow
     of Mythic Heroes

    Nocked and Loaded![Song][Claw]
Also received…
[Helm]Lunar Helm!

Yang:I can't sleep while
you're fighting.
Count me in.

Cecil:Everyone!

Tellah:Who is Golbez?
($09)($09)($09)Edward:All…all I know is
he's gathering the
Crystals…using the Red
Wings… -sob-
Tellah:Enough! Tears won't
bring Anna back!
($09)($09)Curse you,Golbez! I'm
coming to avenge my
daughter!!

Porom:That is the reason
we accompanied you.
Palom:Sorry we didn't
tell you.
Cecil:A logical choice.
I would've done the same.
($09)($09)Elder:But you overcame
your past and are now a
paladin! How marvelous -
…?! That…sword…
Cecil:I received it on
Mt.Ordeals.
Elder:It's engraved with
the Mysidian Legend!

Edge:And how can we be
so sure you won't lose
your mind to Zemus?

Yang:Who are you?
Edge:I'm Prince Edge
of Eblan.They have me,
so you get better.
Yang:But I must…
Sylph:Don't force
yourself! We'll help them
instead!

King:Yang,I'm honored to
see you again.It's clear
that your training has
served you well.
Yet,I sense you forget
defense can be as powerful
as offense.
Therefore…
…Allow me to teach you
once more.

Kain:Rosa…
($09)($09)($09)Rosa:Golbez was also
under Zemus' control.
It's no fault of
Kain's.
Kain:Golbez…too?

Sorcerer Golbez can now
join your party!
($09)($09)NOTE:Golbez will not gain
EXP or levels if not on
the active team.

Cecil:You're not the only
one suffering.I'm sure
Anna would want you to
help those in need.
I'm Cecil.I'm looking
for a [Crystal]Sand Ruby to help
my ill friend in Kaipo.
($09)Edward:You need…me?
Cecil:Yes,you.

I…don't believe it…!
You…actually did it!!
Here,you've earned this.
($09)($09)   Received the Fabled
     -[Armor]Mystic Armor-[Song][Dark Sword]

King:Cecil,you have
earned the right to use
one of these mirrors.
($09)It allows one to assume
the power of dark or light
at will.Use it wisely.
($09)Received [Crystal]Lunarian Mirror!

Fusoya:This is the heart
of the Giant,the CPU!
($09)($09)We must destroy it!

King:Brace yourself wisely
in battle,and none shall
break your guard!
($09)Yang:Yes,Your Majesty!
($09)($09)($09)Command Upgrade:
Brace will now make Yang
invincible to physical
damage.[Song][Claw]

Golbez:I've had enough of
you foiling my plans!
Time to pay!!
($09)Fusoya:You!

Golbez:G-Get back!
Fusoya:Don't you realize
who you are? Wake up!
($09)Fusoya used [Crystal]Crystal! 

Golbez:…Am I…free…of the
hatred…?
($09)($09)Fusoya:You've come to your
senses…Theodor.
Do you recall your
father's name?
Golbez:My father? His name
is…KluYa.
Cecil:…What?
Rosa:That means…
Cecil:Golbez is my…
brother?
($09)($09)Fusoya:Zemus is a
telepath.Your Lunarian
blood made it easy for him
to use you.

Cecil:I've been fighting
my own brother all along…
Golbez:Brother…I…I'm
sorry.
Cecil:That means…it could
have been me! I could
have become Zemus' pawn.
($09)Golbez:But you didn't.My
soul was stained with
evil,and so I…
I…!

Cecil:Where are you
going?
($09)($09)Golbez:To settle this once
and for all!!

Cid:You wanna chase
after 'em?!
($09)($09)Move the airship with the
D-Pad.Press A to get on 'n
off.Ya can't land on a
forest,mountain,or desert.
Press Y to toggle slow 
mode - it's great for a
precise landin'!
($09)Cecil:…No.Set course for
Troia.
Cid:…
($09)…Well,she's surrounded by
thick woods to the
northwest.
($09)We can't land the
Enterprise nearby - we're
gonna have to get there
another way.

Fusoya:Zemus is a fellow
Lunarian.It is my
responsibility to stop
him.I'll join you.

  Sword of Dark Eternal
      - [Sword]Valhalla -
         Ascends!
($09)Received [Ring]Omega Ring!
($09)($09)($09)Rydia learned
[Black]BlackHole!

Edge:Are you gonna just
let him go like this?
Rosa:He may lose his
life!
Cecil:…
($09)($09)($09)Rydia:…He is your big
brother.
($09)($09)Cecil:My…brother…


Edge:It's collapsing!
Rydia:We need to go!
Rosa:Cecil!
Cecil:…

Rydia:We're not gonna
make it to the exit!!
($09)($09)?:This way!

Fusoya:Is everyone
alright?
($09)($09)…
($09)($09)($09)The situation is dire.
Zeromus must be dealt
with.
($09)Let us return to the
Lunar Whale for now.

Kain:I've regained my
senses at last.I'm ready
to face the consequences
of my actions.

This mountain is so
peaceful.Why don't
you rest here…
($09)…for all eternity!

Rosa:Golbez is Cecil's
brother…
Cecil:…
($09)Rosa:A Lunarian named
Zemus controlled him from
the Moon.
($09)Kain:So even Golbez was
a pawn in the end…
Then I know who I must
face.

Edge:Then I'm going,too.
I've got a score to settle
with Zemus,myself.
Cecil:Then it's decided.

Yang:Oh,Cecil!
Cecil:Yang!
Rydia:You're alive!
($09)Yang:The sylphs saved me
when I was in trouble.
Rosa:Your bravery saved
the dwarves.
Yang:I'll…go with you…
Sylph:No! You stay and
rest!

Edge:Now Rydia,be a
good girl and stay home.
Rydia:Don't talk to me!

Edge:Well,we've got our
own little army now,
Cecil.C'mon! Let's kick
Zemus' tail!
Cecil:Agreed.
If anyone has unfinished
business,please speak now.
($09)Yang:I would like to
train at Fabul one last
time.
($09)Cecil:Alright.
Any others?
($09)($09)Porom:It's likely Elder
has something for Palom
and me.May we return to
Mysidia?
Palom:Ooh,great idea!
I said it first!
Porom:-sigh-
($09)Cecil:Of course we can
go.
…And you,Edward?
($09)Edward:I am prepared.
I am ready to share with
the world the love that
Anna has shown me.
Yet now I see that a
warrior must wield more
than love alone.
($09)The Troian doctor has
honed my chemist skill -
I can now Salve any attack
or healing item.
Also…I will no longer Hide
when in peril.You taught
me that courage,Cecil.
Cecil:You've quite grown.
Now…everyone!
It's time to end this,
and save the world once
and for all!

Elder:Palom,Porom!
($09)($09)($09)I know that fate is
guiding you both toward
the Moon.
($09)As I cannot look after you
two while you follow your
path…
($09)I must teach you one
last lesson.It shall aid
you in this darkest of
hours.
It is time you learn…
the Power of the Cosmos,
the Ultimate Twin Magic
of Mysidia!

That foul little Dark Elf!
($09)($09)($09)He got the Earth Crystal
before me…
Curse his magical prowess…
Hmph!
…
($09)($09)($09)…Wait a moment,something
much more valuable just
waltzed in.
($09)Why,hello.
Aren't you that renegade
that Baron's after?
Cecil…am I right?
Hehehe…!
The fearsome Captain of
the Red Wings,reduced to
a common bounty…
I'll bet you'll fetch
quite the reward,even if I
turn in just your head…
Hehehe!!

Cecil:…Edge,activate
the crystal.We're going
back to Earth,now.
($09)Rosa:Don't you dare!
Cecil:Why are you doing
this?!
($09)Rosa:Cecil,can't you
understand? It doesn't
matter how dangerous
it gets…
All I want is to fight
by your side!
($09)($09)Yang:There's no love
stronger than one forged
in battle,Cecil.
($09)Rosa:Oh!
Hello,Yang!
($09)($09)Cecil:…Understood.
Rosa…
Whatever happens…
($09)I will protect you![Song]($13)

Edge:Rydia!
($09)($09)($09)Rydia:Didn't I say we're
all fighting for a common
cause? Besides,I'm the
only caller you have!
Cecil:Rydia…
You're right.
Let's do this!

Cecil:But Rosa,Rydia.
You get off here.
Rosa:Cecil!!
Rydia:What?!
Cecil:It's too risky.
There's no guarantee of
safe return this time.
($09)Rosa:I can't believe
this…
Cecil:Please get off the
Lunar Whale.

Goddess:Halt.
Such imprudence is
impermissible.
($09)You may not yet wield this
Destructive Power.
Attempting so shall invite
certain death.
Seek first the Goddess and
then return.Only then
shall you stand a chance.
($09)I shall await you. 

King:…I see.Yang,go with
them.We owe Cecil much.
A ship will be arranged
soon.
Cecil,take this blade.A
wandering dark knight left
it here long ago.
($09)Just remember…a dark sword
will never truly conquer
evil.

Cecil:…

Neo Bahamut:I have one
last gift.You are he who
will probe the depths of
the Crystal Spire.
I entrust you with this.
($09)($09)($09)Received [Key]Lunar Key!

We are the Absolute
Darkness…
The product of Zemus'
hatred…

Received…
[Black]Anti-Matter!
[Black]Void Stone!

Cecil:Zeromus!
($09)($09)($09)For all those living on
Earth…
($09)($09)I will vanquish you!

…We…will…not…perish…as…
long…as…there…is…evil…in…
the…hearts…of…people…
-huff-
Grr…ZRR…
($09)($09)($09)GRRAAAHH!!

Welcome,children.
I sense you've felled that
heinous Goddess.
($09)I thank you for proving I
am the stronger deity.
That fool was never fit to
guard [Sword]Ultima.
Hmph,the 'Power of Light.'
So unlike my sorcery of
the four elements.
($09)I shall reward you all
with a shower of flame,
frost,volt,and gale.
($09)None have succeeded in
countering my magic.
You will be lain to waste.
Ha-ha-ha-ha!!

Fusoya:I had no idea you
had such strength! You're
more powerful than we
Lunarians.

Elder:What do you want
from us this time?
($09)($09)Cecil:I am Cecil,
ex-captain of the Red
Wings.I've come to beg
forgiveness for my sins.
Elder:Apologies won't
bring back our fallen
friends.However,I'll
listen to your plight.
Cecil:Thank you.
I'm battling one called
Golbez,the mastermind of
Baron.He has captured
someone dear to me.My
comrades and I set out to
rescue her,but Leviathan
sundered the ship…
Elder:It would seem this
is your trial…but as long
as you depend on the dark
sword,you'll never defeat
true evil.Moreover,you
could be consumed by its
darkness at any time.
($09)Cecil:Yes,I know this -
Rosa is in danger!
($09)($09)Elder:You can save no one
as you are now! You would
need to climb Mt.Ordeals
and become a paladin.
Cecil:Paladin?
Elder:This warrior is he
who wields the sacred
light.
However,many have sought
to overcome Mt.Ordeals,
yet none returned.
Will you try?
Cecil:…I will.
($09)($09)($09)Elder:With your dark sword
alone,this trial may prove
too dire.I'll have my
apprentices join you.
Palom! Porom!

    The Legendary Lyre
      - [Harp]Loki Lute -
         Attained!

Cecil:Who are you?
($09)($09)($09)I am Fusoya,guardian of
the Lunarians' slumber.
($09)($09)Rosa:Lunarians?
Fusoya:Yes.Millennia ago,
a planet between Jupiter
and Mars was destroyed.
The people who survived
this escaped on arks and
headed for the Blue
Planet - your world,Earth.
However,the people of
that planet were still in
the process of evolution.
($09)Thus,the Lunarians made
a second moon and went to
sleep.
($09)Edge:I don't believe
this!

Fusoya:But one man
refused.He wanted to take
the Blue Planet for
himself.
I forced him to sleep,but
his mind remained lucid.

Cecil:Who is he?
Fusoya:Zemus,the one who
orchestrated the conquest
of the Crystals.
Rydia:Golbez's master?!
Fusoya:He needed the
Crystals to activate the
Tower of Babil,and in
turn revive the Giant of
Babil - all so he could
annihilate the people of
Earth.
Edge:Hey,did you guys
make the Lunar Whale?
($09)($09)Fusoya:That was created by
my brother,KluYa,to visit
the Blue Planet.
($09)He taught your kind to
build airships,and
devised the Devil Road.
($09)There,he fell in love
with a woman named
Cecilia.Soon thereafter,
she conceived.
You are KluYa's son,
Cecil.

Mechanics:Readying
cannons,Chief!

Cecil:Then the light of
Mt.Ordeals was…!
Fusoya:Indeed,the spirit
of KluYa.
Cecil:My father is that
light…
($09)($09)Fusoya:KluYa gave you his
power to thwart Zemus'
devilry.
($09)He must be stopped,for the
sake of all living things!
Come,make haste for the
Tower of Babil.
Rosa:But the Crystal
Room - won't Golbez have
it shielded?

Fusoya:I can neutralize
the shield.
I'll go with you.
($09)All-Mage Fusoya joined![Song][Claw]($05)[Float]

Cecil:But Zeromus' last
words…

'As long as there is evil
in the hearts of people…'
($09)($09)Fusoya:Each of us bears
a touch of darkness,as
surely as we bear light.
($09)It is much the same as the
twin sets of Crystals and
worlds.Yet as long as
there is darkness,
so too will there be
light - just as your
brilliance triumphed over
Zemus.

In the end,we really did
triumph…
It's incredible.

Sage Tellah joined!($05)[Float]($06)

Rydia:…No.I hate fire!
Cecil:It's because Mist
was destroyed by fire
when…

Fusoya:I must return to my
slumber.What will you do?

Cecil:We'll go back to
Earth.There are people
expecting us.

Fusoya:I see.
You were great allies.I
look forward to seeing
how humanity evolves.

Golbez:May I join you?
I can never go back,
considering what I've
done.
Besides,I'd like to
meet my father's people.
($09)($09)Fusoya:If you wish,but it
will be a very long
sleep.
Golbez:I understand.

Golbez:I'm sorry,Cecil.
($09)($09)($09)Cecil:…
($09)($09)($09)Golbez:…I know you can
never forgive or forget
my actions.I caused you
such anguish…

Fusoya:We must go now.
May your all your lives be
prosperous.

Cecil…
($09)($09)($09)It's your last chance,
Cecil!
($09)($09)Say something!

Received…
($09)($09)($09)[Helm]Grand Helm!
[Helm]Ribbon!
[Black]Void Stone!
[Black]Anti-Matter!
Command Upgrade:
Dark will no longer
consume Dark Knight
Cecil's HP.

Cecil:…
($09)($09)($09)Goodbye,Theodor.
($09)($09)($09)…My brother!

Fusoya:Cecil,take this
[Crystal]Crystal.Let its Power of
Light guide you…
Cecil:But what about you?
Fusoya:I will remain here
to aid your engineer.Kluya
had mastered the skies,but
I have mastered the stars.
Golbez:Cecil…I have
faith that you will do
what I could not.
($09)Fusoya:…Theodor.
Go with Cecil.
Golbez:?!
($09)Fusoya:I believe you
have light in you yet,
and together,you will
eradicate Zeromus.
Golbez:…Very well.
Cecil:…Indeed.
He may fight at our side.
His trust will be earned.

Elder:Let's start today's
lesson.
Porom:Yes,Elder.
($05)[Shuriken]
Elder:…Where's Palom?
Porom:Again?
I'll retrieve him!($05)[Frog]($06)

Palom:…It was then I cast
[Black]Ice to douse the flames…($05)[Frog]($06)

Palom:Ow!
Porom:Leave that girl
alone!
Elder's waiting for you.($05)[Knife]($06)

Elder:How many times must
I tell you not to skip
lessons? You deserve extra
homework tonight.($05)[White]($06)

Palom:Please,no!($05)($12)($06)

Porom:Ha-ha!
Serves you right.($05)($12)($06)

Steward:Your Highness,
as future ruler of our
kingdom,you have
obligations to uphold!($05)[Shuriken]($06)

Edge:I got it!($05)($10)($06)

Steward:Sire,you cannot
keep chasing after a
fantasy.($05)[Shuriken]
Edge:Yeah,yeah…
Steward:I beg you,sire…($05)[Frog]($06)

Edge:Hmm…Rydia.
There's just no one else
who could ever measure up
to you.($05)[Shuriken]($06)

Asura:I never thought that
she would return.
Leviathan:Indeed.
($05)[Staff]
?:Rydia!($05)($12)($06)

Rydia:Right,Cecil?($05)($10)($06)

Esper Child:Why don't you
have fangs like us,
Rydia?
Are we different?($05)[Shuriken]($06)

Rydia:Nope!
There's nothing different
between us.($05)[Mute]($06)

Asura:It's about to get
much livelier around here.
Leviathan:Yes,she's truly
a remarkable girl.($05)[Shuriken]($06)

Rydia:…What's inside is
what matters most.($05)($12)($06)

King Edward!($05)($12)($06)

Boy:Sing us the Song of
the Paladin again!
Edward:Let's finish
today's work first.($05)($20)
Don't you want to rebuild
our castle?($05)[Pig]($06)

Girl:OK,it's a promise!($05)($1C)($06)

Edward:Do you see me,Anna?
I'll help the people of
Damcyan for us both.($05)[Blind]
($09)Tellah,please keep her
company…($05)($16)($06)

Sheila:Honey!($05)($12)($06)

Yang:Stop calling me
that,please.
You're a queen now.
($05)[Shuriken]
Sheila:You know I hate
formalities.Anyway -
Yang:Oh,you're right.
Time for training!($05)[Armor]($06)

Former King:I'm sure that
you and Yang will lead

I'm the one in charge.($05)($11)($06)

Kain:Cecil…Rosa…

I can surpass my father as
a dragoon…($05)[Armor]

Oh!($05)($0A)($06)

Elder:Divine Moon!

Mighty Palom will help
you!
Elder:Palom! Behave!

be of aid.

defeated me,but for my
valiance I have become an
Esper.
I will answer as your
caller beckons…if you can

you,and I shall fight
by your side.

fight,Odin may arrive to
quickly dispatch your

Kain?

Kain!

Cecil:…That light said…
'My son.'

Tellah:Your effort shall
not be in vain!

Cecil:I'm coming for you,
Golbez…!

Cecil:I'm sorry…
Golbez took the Crystal.
Giott:Then we must protect
the last.
Rosa:Where is it?
Giott:In the Sealed Cave,
but worry not - none can
enter without the key.
Kain:Golbez's forces
approach.What do we do?
($09)($09)Giott:You're going
to retrieve the other
Crystals from the
Tower of Babil.

Cecil:No,it's nothing.
Let's rest.

Cecil:Everyone OK?
($09)($09)($09)Cid:Yeah.
But Enterprise ain't.
She can't fly like this.
Cecil:Let's disembark.

Palom:I'm the Mysidian
prodigy,Palom!

Porom:Feel free to ignore
him.I'm his twin sister,
Porom.
Palom:You hurt us,man!

Cecil:Hand over the
Water Crystal!
Elder:What have we done
to warrant this?!
Cecil:The Crystal or your
lives!
($09)($09)Black Mage:Are you mad?!
How could we possibly
choose?!
($09)Cecil:…I'm afraid you
just did.
($09)($09)Red Wings,use whatever
means necessary to take
the Crystal!

Black Mages:AAAAGH!!

White Mage:Please,I beg
of you…!!


Elder:Please! No more!
Take the Crystal and
leave! My people have done

think to wield the Blade
of Shadow?

       Unsheathed!
($09)Wielding the [Sword]Caladbolg,
Dark Knight Cecil will

this way consumes much
more HP.

Received [Katana]Murasame!
($09)($09)($09)Rydia learned [Black]Aero! 

King?:'Your Majesty'? Oh,
you mean that old duffer
who refused to surrender
his kingdom.
Cecil:You…!!
($09)($09)($09)King?:You want to see him?
Don't worry,I'll send you
to him soon enough.
($09)I'm not weak like Milon.
That fool never deserved
to be a Fiend.
($09)($09)Cecil:Then you're…!

Old Man:Dark knight,hear
my plea.
($09)($09)A wicked bard tricked my
daughter into running away
to Damcyan…and I sense
evil in that direction!
Cecil:You must be Sage
Tellah.

Cecil:But who are they
fighting?
Cid:We gotta get outta
here! Hold on!!

Woe unto him who seeks the
Spear of Light!

This Sacred Ribbon shall
not touch your hands!

This sword,reviled by Lord
Zemus,will never have its
power unleashed!

Lugae:Hee-hee! This tower
connects the two worlds.
($09)($09)Rubicant already moved
the Crystals to the
Overworld!
($09)All that's left is to
annihilate the dwarves
with our Super Cannon!
($09)Hee-hee-hee!!

Those who seek to bear
this blade shall sooner
visit Hell!

Yang:That means they're
after the Wind Crystal as
well!
($09)Edward:Assuredly so.
Damcyan has already been
raided.
($09)Yang:Fabul is helpless…
Only students remain in
the castle.

Pathetic humans.Quite bold
of you to defy me,an
eternal,flawless machine.

Powering me down is
futile - my code endures.
When my system reboots,I
shall rise once again…

The Lunar Core is now
magnetized.

Cecil:Strange…
There was no malice in
that beast's attacks.
Only anger.

Halt.
($09)($09)($09)Cecil:Zemus…
($09)($09)($09)Zemus:When I lost both my
mortal tools,I almost knew
human rage.
($09)I now see that your
journey must be ended
here.
($09)Cecil:Think again!

I am Ultima Weapon…
($09)($09)($09)I am pure energy…
and as ancient as the
cosmos.
($09)Feeble creatures…
DIE!

Ouch!

I see you have obtained
[Sword]Ultima…
($09)($09)Perhaps you are worthy of
my challenge after all…
Prepare yourself!

My comrades!
A moment,please!

A sudden surge of
magnetism flows through
the Lunar Core…
($09)Cheating,huh?
Well,enjoy your reward!

Is that…[Sword]Ultima?!
($09)($09)($09)I've coveted that sword…
for so long…
Give it to me…NOW!!

    Scourge of Legend
    - [Whip]Slaying Tail -

($09)A warmth surrounds you…
($09)($09)($09)Received [Helm]Adamant Helm!

Cecil:Your Majesty?!
($09)($09)($09)King:Indeed,Cecil.
My spirit has made home on
the Moon so I may uncover
the Lunarians' secrets.
I am prepared to pass
these secrets unto you -
if your new strength
rivals my own.
As put forth by Esper Law,
I challenge you to trial
by combat.Have at you!

Rosa:The Giant's
confused!

Kain:I've got a score to
settle in the Lunar Core.

Rydia:My whole life has
been leading to this
moment…
I'm coming with you!

Rosa:Don't worry about
me.We can keep each other
safe.Let's go.

Edge:C'mon…you'll never
make it without me!

Yang:For the honor of
Fabul,and the whole world.

Palom:Zemus is no match
for the Mysidian genius,
Palom!

Porom:Would you like some
help? My magic will
protect you from the
gravest danger.

Edward:I've learned much
on this journey of
hardship…and now,I can
fight.

Cid:Bah…I'm still
pretty banged up from all
those fancy moves in the
Underworld.
Don't expect me on the
front lines…but I'll stick
around the ship to
maintain her 'n study up!

Cid:Knock Zemus dead![Song][Pig]

Cid:Fascinating flight
technology…[Song][Pig]

King:Cecil,let your light
shine from within…!

King:Darkness and evil are
not inherently interwoven.
Let your power of dark
be unleashed…!

All party members removed.

Rydia:…?
($09)($09)($09)…Mom…?
($09)($09)($09)Mother:Yes,Rydia.
My dear child…it's been
so wonderful to see you
thriving.
You have grown to be both
strong and brave,and
you've flourished as a
gifted caller.
…But…sweetheart…
I have to leave soon.
I'm sorry…
($09)Rydia:…Mom…
($09)($09)($09)Mother:I can't look after
you anymore…but I know who
can.
($09)With the last of my life
force,I gift you the
Final Esper of Mist.
($09)May it protect you in
your journey.
($09)($09)…It's time.
I have to go…
($09)($09)Goodbye,my beloved Rydia.

this is! And to ease your
burden of loneliness,I
shall stick around!
But enough expository
banter.It's time we fight
again!
($09)Speak with me whenever
you wish to spar!

Gilgamesh:HA! Did you
really think you could
so easily defeat the
Mighty Gilgamesh?!

Gilgamesh:The greatest
thrill lies in a true
challenge! You have proven
your strength and honor.
For your valiance,I shall
bestow you with these!

King:Your light shines
brilliantly,Cecil…
The world depends on you.
($09)I shall wait for you on
the Lunar Whale.
($09)($09)Come to me when you wish
to learn the true nature
of light and darkness.

($09)($09)($09)As ninja of Eblan and heir
to the throne…
You have my promise.

Goddess:I concede defeat.
The power you possess is
quite profound…
($09)I deem you worthy.

the Gods of Old.
