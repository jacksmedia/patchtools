# Python Patchtools

## Overview: Use these to
- produce IPS files against a default rom (patch-maker.py)
- apply multiple patches to a rom, rapidly (multipatcher.py)
- unzip multiple archive files & rename contents after archive (unzipper.py)
- pull all sfc files from sub-folders into the working folder (file-finder.py)

## How To Use these
- change filenames at the end of the script to match your own roms and directories
- type ```python script-name.py``` into a Command Prompt
